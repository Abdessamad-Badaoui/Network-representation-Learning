# Research Project: Unsupervised Network Representation Learning

This project is based on the paper by Khosla, Megha, Vinay Setty, and Avishek Anand titled [A Comparative Study for Unsupervised Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07902), published in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (2019). The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate various unsupervised network representation learning methods as discussed in the paper.

## Tasks Overview

**Implementation of Methods** :
    Implement the following network representation learning methods: DeepWalk, Node2vec, Line-1, NetMF, and GraphSage.
    Use standard machine learning and deep learning languages such as Python and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

**Data Collection** :
    Gather all datasets presented in the paper.
    Search for and include additional datasets from different domains, ensuring they are at least as large as the ones in the original paper.

**Evaluation** :
    Evaluate the implemented methods on the collected datasets with respect to link prediction and node classification tasks.

**Reproducibility and Generalization** :
    Discuss the reproducibility of the results reported in the original paper based on your experiments.
    Assess whether the methods generalize to the new datasets.

**Discussion** :
    Provide an analysis of the original paper in terms of its approach, methodology, and conclusions.

**Summary of Learnings** :
    Summarize the most interesting findings and insights gained throughout the project.
